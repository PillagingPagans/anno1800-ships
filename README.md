# Anno 1800 - Ships Rebalance

This modular mod project's intended gameplay impact is the following:
1. The Zephyr Airship (with Arctic gas) is the luxury option for mass transport inside a session (very high upkeep and very high influence).
2. The Pegasus is the overall best option for transporting goods within a session (very high upkeep and high influence).
3. The Cargo Ship is the budget king for mass transport inside a session (low upkeep and low influence).
4. The Extravaganza Steamer is an overall upgrade to the Cargo Ship and is more useful than in the vanilla game (high upkeep and low influence).
5. The World-Class Reefer is the king of inter session transport (high upkeep and medium influence).
6. The Great Eastern is the expedition king, and also a luxury option for mass transport of goods in a session (high upkeep and very high influence).
